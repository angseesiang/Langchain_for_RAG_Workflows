Once or twice she had peeped into the\\nbook her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in\\nit, \"and what is the use of a book,\" thought Alice, \"without pictures or\\nconversations?\"\\n\\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\\nday made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\\nmaking a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\\npicking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\\nclose by her.\\n\\nThere was nothing so very remarkable in that, nor did Alice think it so\\nvery much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \"Oh dear! Oh\\ndear! I shall be too late!\" But when the Rabbit actually took a watch\\nout of its waistcoat-pocket and looked at it and then hurried on, Alice\\nstarted to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never\\nbefore seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take\\nout of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after\\nit and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole, under\\nthe hedge. In another moment, down went Alice after it!\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then\\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed\\nto be a very deep well.\\n\\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\\nplenty of time, as she went down, to look about her. First, she tried to\\nmake out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything;\\nthen she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were\\nfilled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and\\npictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as\\nshe passed. It was labeled \"ORANGE MARMALADE,\" but, to her great\\ndisappointment, it was empty; she did not like to drop the jar, so\\nmanaged to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.\\n\\nDown, down, down! Would the fall never come to an end? There was nothing\\nelse to do, so Alice soon began talking to herself. \"Dinah\\'ll miss me\\nvery much to-night, I should think!\" (Dinah was the cat.) \"I hope\\nthey\\'ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear, I wish\\nyou were down here with me!\" Alice felt that she was dozing off, when\\nsuddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry\\nleaves, and the fall was over.\\n\\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up in a moment. She looked up,\\nbut it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage and\\nthe White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a\\nmoment to be lost. Away went Alice like the wind and was just in time to\\nhear it say, as it turned a corner, \"Oh, my ears and whiskers, how late\\nit\\'s getting!\" She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but\\nthe Rabbit was no longer to be seen.\\n\\nShe found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of\\nlamps hanging from the roof. There were doors all \\'round the hall, but\\nthey were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side\\nand up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,\\nwondering how she was ever to get out again.\\n\\nSuddenly she came upon a little table, all made of solid glass. There\\nwas nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice\\'s first idea was that\\nthis might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the\\nlocks were too large, or the key was too small, but, at any rate, it\\nwould not open any of them. However, on the second time \\'round, she came\\nupon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a\\nlittle door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key\\nin the lock, and to her great delight, it fitted!\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\\nmuch larger than a rat-hole; she knelt down and looked along the passage\\ninto the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of\\nthat dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and\\nthose cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the\\ndoorway. \"Oh,\" said Alice, \"how I wish I could shut up like a telescope!\\nI think I could, if I only knew how to begin.\"\\n\\nAlice went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on\\nit, or at any rate, a book of rules for shutting people up like\\ntelescopes. This time she found a little bottle on it (\"which certainly\\nwas not here before,\" said Alice), and tied \\'round the neck of the\\nbottle was a paper label, with the words \"DRINK ME\" beautifully printed\\non it in large letters.\\n\\n\"No, I\\'ll look first,\" she said, \"and see whether it\\'s marked \\'_poison_\\'\\nor not,\" for she had never forgotten that, if you drink from a bottle\\nmarked \"poison,\" it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or\\nlater. However, this bottle was _not_ marked \"poison,\" so Alice ventured\\nto taste it, and, finding it very nice (it had a sort of mixed flavor of\\ncherry-tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, toffy and hot buttered\\ntoast), she very soon finished it off.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\"What a curious feeling!\" said Alice. \"I must be shutting up like a\\ntelescope!\"\\n\\nAnd so it was indeed! She was now only ten inches high, and her face\\nbrightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\\nthrough the little door into that lovely garden.\\n\\nAfter awhile, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\\ninto the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! When she got to the\\ndoor, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\\nwent back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\\nit: she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her\\nbest to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery,\\nand when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\\nsat down and cried.\\n\\n\"Come, there\\'s no use in crying like that!\" said Alice to herself rather\\nsharply. \"I advise you to leave off this minute!\" She generally gave\\nherself very good advice (though she very seldom followed it), and\\nsometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her\\neyes.\\n\\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\\nshe opened it and found in it a very small cake, on which the words \"EAT\\nME\" were beautifully marked in currants. \"Well, I\\'ll eat it,\" said\\nAlice, \"and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it\\nmakes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door: so either way I\\'ll\\nget into the garden, and I don\\'t care which happens!\"\\n\\nShe ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself, \"Which way? Which\\nway?\" holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way she was\\ngrowing; and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\\nsize. So she set to work and very soon finished off the cake.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII--THE POOL OF TEARS\\n\\n\\n\"Curiouser and curiouser!\" cried Alice (she was so much surprised that\\nfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English). \"Now I\\'m\\nopening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-by, feet! Oh,\\nmy poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings\\nfor you now, dears? I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\\nmyself about you.\"\\n\\nJust at this moment her head struck against the roof of the hall; in\\nfact, she was now rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took\\nup the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.\\n\\nPoor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\\nlook through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more\\nhopeless than ever. She sat down and began to cry again.\\n\\nShe went on shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all\\n\\'round her and reaching half down the hall.\\n\\nAfter a time, she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and\\nshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White\\nRabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid-gloves in\\none hand and a large fan in the other. He came trotting along in a\\ngreat hurry, muttering to himself, \"Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh!\\n_won\\'t_ she be savage if I\\'ve kept her waiting!\"\\n\\nWhen the Rabbit came near her, Alice began, in a low, timid voice, \"If\\nyou please, sir--\" The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white\\nkid-gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he\\ncould go.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nAlice took up the fan and gloves and she kept fanning herself all the\\ntime she went on talking. \"Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day!\\nAnd yesterday things went on just as usual. _Was_ I the same when I got\\nup this morning? But if I\\'m not the same, the next question is, \\'Who in\\nthe world am I?\\' Ah, _that\\'s_ the great puzzle!\"\\n\\nAs she said this, she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see\\nthat she had put on one of the Rabbit\\'s little white kid-gloves while\\nshe was talking. \"How _can_ I have done that?\" she thought. \"I must be\\ngrowing small again.\" She got up and went to the table to measure\\nherself by it and found that she was now about two feet high and was\\ngoing on shrinking rapidly. She soon found out that the cause of this\\nwas the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily, just in time to\\nsave herself from shrinking away altogether.\\n\\n\"That _was_ a narrow escape!\" said Alice, a good deal frightened at the\\nsudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence. \"And\\nnow for the garden!\" And she ran with all speed back to the little door;\\nbut, alas! the little door was shut again and the little golden key was\\nlying on the glass table as before. \"Things are worse than ever,\"\\nthought the poor child, \"for I never was so small as this before,\\nnever!\"\\n\\nAs she said these words, her foot slipped, and in another moment,\\nsplash! she was up to her chin in salt-water. Her first idea was that\\nshe had somehow fallen into the sea. However, she soon made out that she\\nwas in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\\noff, and she swam nearer to see what it was: she soon made out that it\\nwas only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.\\n\\n\"Would it be of any use, now,\" thought Alice, \"to speak to this mouse?\\nEverything is so out-of-the-way down here that I should think very\\nlikely it can talk; at any rate, there\\'s no harm in trying.\" So she\\nbegan, \"O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\\nof swimming about here, O Mouse!\" The Mouse looked at her rather\\ninquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but\\nit said nothing.\\n\\n\"Perhaps it doesn\\'t understand English,\" thought Alice. \"I dare say it\\'s\\na French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.\" So she began\\nagain: \"Où est ma chatte?\" which was the first sentence in her French\\nlesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to\\nquiver all over with fright. \"Oh, I beg your pardon!\" cried Alice\\nhastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal\\'s feelings. \"I quite\\nforgot you didn\\'t like cats.\"\\n\\n\"Not like cats!\" cried the Mouse in a shrill, passionate voice. \"Would\\n_you_ like cats, if you were me?\"\\n\\n\"Well, perhaps not,\" said Alice in a soothing tone; \"don\\'t be angry\\nabout it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah. I think you\\'d\\ntake a fancy to cats, if you could only see her. She is such a dear,\\nquiet thing.\" The Mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it\\nmust be really offended. \"We won\\'t talk about her any more, if you\\'d\\nrather not.\"\\n\\n\"We, indeed!\" cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of its\\ntail. \"As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always _hated_\\ncats--nasty, low, vulgar things! Don\\'t let me hear the name again!\"\\n\\n[Illustration: Alice at the Mad Tea Party.]\\n\\n\"I won\\'t indeed!\" said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\\nconversation. \"Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs? There is such a nice\\nlittle dog near our house, I should like to show you! It kills all the\\nrats and--oh, dear!\" cried Alice in a sorrowful tone. \"I\\'m afraid I\\'ve\\noffended it again!\" For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as\\nit could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.\\n\\nSo she called softly after it, \"Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\\nwon\\'t talk about cats, or dogs either, if you don\\'t like them!\" When the\\nMouse heard this, it turned \\'round and swam slowly back to her; its face\\nwas quite pale, and it said, in a low, trembling voice, \"Let us get to\\nthe shore and then I\\'ll tell you my history and you\\'ll understand why it\\nis I hate cats and dogs.\"\\n\\nIt was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\\nbirds and animals that had fallen into it; there were a Duck and a Dodo,\\na Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the\\nway and the whole party swam to the shore.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII--A CAUCUS-RACE AND A LONG TALE\\n\\n\\nThey were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the\\nbirds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close\\nto them, and all dripping wet, cross and uncomfortable.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe first question, of course, was how to get dry again. They had a\\nconsultation about this and after a few minutes, it seemed quite natural\\nto Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had\\nknown them all her life.\\n\\nAt last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of some authority among\\nthem, called out, \"Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I\\'ll_ soon\\nmake you dry enough!\" They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with\\nthe Mouse in the middle.\\n\\n\"Ahem!\" said the Mouse with an important air. \"Are you all ready? This\\nis the driest thing I know. Silence all \\'round, if you please! \\'William\\nthe Conqueror, whose cause was favored by the pope, was soon submitted\\nto by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much\\naccustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the Earls of\\nMercia and Northumbria\\'--\"\\n\\n\"Ugh!\" said the Lory, with a shiver.\\n\\n\"--\\'And even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it\\nadvisable\\'--\"\\n\\n\"Found _what_?\" said the Duck.\\n\\n\"Found _it_,\" the Mouse replied rather crossly; \"of course, you know\\nwhat \\'it\\' means.\"\\n\\n\"I know what \\'it\\' means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,\" said the\\nDuck; \"it\\'s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the\\narchbishop find?\"\\n\\nThe Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, \"\\'--found\\nit advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the\\ncrown.\\'--How are you getting on now, my dear?\" it continued, turning to\\nAlice as it spoke.\\n\\n\"As wet as ever,\" said Alice in a melancholy tone; \"it doesn\\'t seem to\\ndry me at all.\"\\n\\n\"In that case,\" said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, \"I move that\\nthe meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic\\nremedies--\"\\n\\n\"Speak English!\" said the Eaglet. \"I don\\'t know the meaning of half\\nthose long words, and, what\\'s more, I don\\'t believe you do either!\"\\n\\n\"What I was going to say,\" said the Dodo in an offended tone, \"is that\\nthe best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.\"\\n\\n\"What _is_ a Caucus-race?\" said Alice.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\"Why,\" said the Dodo, \"the best way to explain it is to do it.\" First it\\nmarked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, and then all the party\\nwere placed along the course, here and there. There was no \"One, two,\\nthree and away!\" but they began running when they liked and left off\\nwhen they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over.\\nHowever, when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite\\ndry again, the Dodo suddenly called out, \"The race is over!\" and they\\nall crowded \\'round it, panting and asking, \"But who has won?\"\\n\\nThis question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought.\\nAt last it said, \"_Everybody_ has won, and _all_ must have prizes.\"\\n\\n\"But who is to give the prizes?\" quite a chorus of voices asked.\\n\\n\"Why, _she_, of course,\" said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one\\nfinger; and the whole party at once crowded \\'round her, calling out, in\\na confused way, \"Prizes! Prizes!\"\\n\\nAlice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand into her\\npocket and pulled out a box of comfits (luckily the salt-water had not\\ngot into it) and handed them \\'round as prizes. There was exactly one\\na-piece, all \\'round.\\n\\nThe next thing was to eat the comfits; this caused some noise and\\nconfusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste\\ntheirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.\\nHowever, it was over at last and they sat down again in a ring and\\nbegged the Mouse to tell them something more.\\n\\n\"You promised to tell me your history, you know,\" said Alice, \"and why\\nit is you hate--C and D,\" she added in a whisper, half afraid that it\\nwould be offended again.\\n\\n\"Mine is a long and a sad tale!\" said the Mouse, turning to Alice and\\nsighing.\\n\\n\"It _is_ a long tail, certainly,\" said Alice, looking down with wonder\\nat the Mouse\\'s tail, \"but why do you call it sad?\" And she kept on\\npuzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the\\ntale was something like this:--\\n\\n    \"Fury said to\\n      a mouse, That\\n         he met in the\\n            house, \\'Let\\n              us both go\\n                to law: _I_\\n                 will prosecute\\n               _you_.--\\n                 Come, I\\'ll\\n              take no denial:\\n             We\\n           must have\\n        the trial;\\n     For really\\n    this morning\\n    I\\'ve\\n    nothing\\n    to do.\\'\\n    Said the\\n     mouse to\\n      the cur,\\n       \\'Such a\\n        trial, dear\\n           sir, With\\n               no jury\\n                or judge,\\n                   would\\n                  be wasting\\n                our\\n             breath.\\'\\n         \\'I\\'ll be\\n        judge,\\n       I\\'ll be\\n      jury,\\'\\n     said\\n    cunning\\n    old\\n     Fury;\\n      \\'I\\'ll\\n       try\\n        the\\n         whole\\n          cause,\\n          and\\n         condemn\\n       you to\\n    death.\\'\"\\n\\n\"You are not attending!\" said the Mouse to Alice, severely. \"What are\\nyou thinking of?\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Alice very humbly, \"you had got to the fifth\\nbend, I think?\"\\n\\n\"You insult me by talking such nonsense!\" said the Mouse, getting up and\\nwalking away.\\n\\n\"Please come back and finish your story!\" Alice called after it. And the\\nothers all joined in chorus, \"Yes, please do!\" But the Mouse only shook\\nits head impatiently and walked a little quicker.\\n\\n\"I wish I had Dinah, our cat, here!\" said Alice. This caused a\\nremarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off at\\nonce, and a Canary called out in a trembling voice, to its children,\\n\"Come away, my dears! It\\'s high time you were all in bed!\" On various\\npretexts they all moved off and Alice was soon left alone.\\n\\n\"I wish I hadn\\'t mentioned Dinah! Nobody seems to like her down here and\\nI\\'m sure she\\'s the best cat in the world!\" Poor Alice began to cry\\nagain, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little while,\\nhowever, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance\\nand she looked up eagerly.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIV--THE RABBIT SENDS IN A LITTLE BILL\\n\\n\\nIt was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again and looking\\nanxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; Alice heard it\\nmuttering to itself, \"The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh, my dear paws! Oh, my\\nfur and whiskers! She\\'ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are\\nferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?\" Alice guessed in a\\nmoment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid-gloves\\nand she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were\\nnowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in\\nthe pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door,\\nhad vanished completely.\\n\\nVery soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, and called to her, in an angry tone,\\n\"Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you doing out here? Run home this moment and\\nfetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!\"\\n\\n\"He took me for his housemaid!\" said Alice, as she ran off. \"How\\nsurprised he\\'ll be when he finds out who I am!\" As she said this, she\\ncame upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\\nplate with the name \"W. RABBIT\" engraved upon it. She went in without\\nknocking and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\\nreal Mary Ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the\\nfan and gloves.\\n\\nBy this time, Alice had found her way into a tidy little room with a\\ntable in the window, and on it a fan and two or three pairs of tiny\\nwhite kid-gloves; she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was\\njust going to leave the room, when her eyes fell upon a little bottle\\nthat stood near the looking-glass. She uncorked it and put it to her\\nlips, saying to herself, \"I do hope it\\'ll make me grow large again, for,\\nreally, I\\'m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\"\\n\\nBefore she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing\\nagainst the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being\\nbroken. She hastily put down the bottle, remarking, \"That\\'s quite\\nenough--I hope I sha\\'n\\'t grow any more.\"\\n\\nAlas! It was too late to wish that! She went on growing and growing and\\nvery soon she had to kneel down on the floor. Still she went on growing,\\nand, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window and one foot\\nup the chimney, and said to herself, \"Now I can do no more, whatever\\nhappens. What _will_ become of me?\"\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect\\nand she grew no larger. After a few minutes she heard a voice outside\\nand stopped to listen.\\n\\n\"Mary Ann! Mary Ann!\" said the voice. \"Fetch me my gloves this moment!\"\\nThen came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was\\nthe Rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the\\nhouse, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large\\nas the Rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it.\\n\\nPresently the Rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it; but as\\nthe door opened inwards and Alice\\'s elbow was pressed hard against it,\\nthat attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself, \"Then I\\'ll\\ngo \\'round and get in at the window.\"\\n\\n\"_That_ you won\\'t!\" thought Alice; and after waiting till she fancied\\nshe heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\\nhand and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\\nbut she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass,\\nfrom which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\\ncucumber-frame or something of that sort.\\n\\nNext came an angry voice--the Rabbit\\'s--\"Pat! Pat! Where are you?\" And\\nthen a voice she had never heard before, \"Sure then, I\\'m here! Digging\\nfor apples, yer honor!\"\\n\\n\"Here! Come and help me out of this! Now tell me, Pat, what\\'s that in\\nthe window?\"\\n\\n\"Sure, it\\'s an arm, yer honor!\"\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s got no business there, at any rate; go and take it away!\"\\n\\nThere was a long silence after this and Alice could only hear whispers\\nnow and then, and at last she spread out her hand again and made another\\nsnatch in the air. This time there were _two_ little shrieks and more\\nsounds of broken glass. \"I wonder what they\\'ll do next!\" thought Alice.\\n\"As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they _could_!\"\\n\\nShe waited for some time without hearing anything more. At last came a\\nrumbling of little cart-wheels and the sound of a good many voices all\\ntalking together. She made out the words: \"Where\\'s the other ladder?\\nBill\\'s got the other--Bill! Here, Bill! Will the roof bear?--Who\\'s to go\\ndown the chimney?--Nay, _I_ sha\\'n\\'t! _You_ do it! Here, Bill! The master\\nsays you\\'ve got to go down the chimney!\"\\n\\nAlice drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till\\nshe heard a little animal scratching and scrambling about in the chimney\\nclose above her; then she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what\\nwould happen next.\\n\\nThe first thing she heard was a general chorus of \"There goes Bill!\"\\nthen the Rabbit\\'s voice alone--\"Catch him, you by the hedge!\" Then\\nsilence and then another confusion of voices--\"Hold up his head--Brandy\\nnow--Don\\'t choke him--What happened to you?\"\\n\\nLast came a little feeble, squeaking voice, \"Well, I hardly know--No\\nmore, thank ye. I\\'m better now--all I know is, something comes at me\\nlike a Jack-in-the-box and up I goes like a sky-rocket!\"\\n\\nAfter a minute or two of silence, they began moving about again, and\\nAlice heard the Rabbit say, \"A barrowful will do, to begin with.\"\\n\\n\"A barrowful of _what_?\" thought Alice. But she had not long to doubt,\\nfor the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\\nwindow and some of them hit her in the face. Alice noticed, with some\\nsurprise, that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they\\nlay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head. \"If I eat one of\\nthese cakes,\" she thought, \"it\\'s sure to make _some_ change in my size.\"\\n\\nSo she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that she\\nbegan shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through\\nthe door, she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little\\nanimals and birds waiting outside. They all made a rush at Alice the\\nmoment she appeared, but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found\\nherself safe in a thick wood.\\n\\n[Illustration: \"The Duchess tucked her arm affectionately into\\nAlice\\'s.\"]\\n\\n\"The first thing I\\'ve got to do,\" said Alice to herself, as she\\nwandered about in the wood, \"is to grow to my right size again; and the\\nsecond thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I suppose I\\nought to eat or drink something or other, but the great question is\\n\\'What?\\'\"\\n\\nAlice looked all around her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but\\nshe could not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or\\ndrink under the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near\\nher, about the same height as herself. She stretched herself up on\\ntiptoe and peeped over the edge and her eyes immediately met those of a\\nlarge blue caterpillar, that was sitting on the top, with its arms\\nfolded, quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice\\nof her or of anything else.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV--ADVICE FROM A CATERPILLAR\\n\\n\\nAt last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and addressed\\nAlice in a languid, sleepy voice.\\n\\n\"Who are _you_?\" said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nAlice replied, rather shyly, \"I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at\\nleast I know who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must\\nhave changed several times since then.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean by that?\" said the Caterpillar, sternly. \"Explain\\nyourself!\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t explain _myself_, I\\'m afraid, sir,\" said Alice, \"because I\\'m\\nnot myself, you see--being so many different sizes in a day is very\\nconfusing.\" She drew herself up and said very gravely, \"I think you\\nought to tell me who _you_ are, first.\"\\n\\n\"Why?\" said the Caterpillar.\\n\\nAs Alice could not think of any good reason and the Caterpillar seemed\\nto be in a _very_ unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.\\n\\n\"Come back!\" the Caterpillar called after her. \"I\\'ve something important\\nto say!\" Alice turned and came back again.\\n\\n\"Keep your temper,\" said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n\"Is that all?\" said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she\\ncould.\\n\\n\"No,\" said the Caterpillar.\\n\\nIt unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said,\\n\"So you think you\\'re changed, do you?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid, I am, sir,\" said Alice. \"I can\\'t remember things as I\\nused--and I don\\'t keep the same size for ten minutes together!\"\\n\\n\"What size do you want to be?\" asked the Caterpillar.\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'m not particular as to size,\" Alice hastily replied, \"only one\\ndoesn\\'t like changing so often, you know. I should like to be a _little_\\nlarger, sir, if you wouldn\\'t mind,\" said Alice. \"Three inches is such a\\nwretched height to be.\"\\n\\n\"It is a very good height indeed!\" said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing\\nitself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).\\n\\nIn a minute or two, the Caterpillar got down off the mushroom and\\ncrawled away into the grass, merely remarking, as it went, \"One side\\nwill make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow\\nshorter.\"\\n\\n\"One side of _what_? The other side of _what_?\" thought Alice to\\nherself.\\n\\n\"Of the mushroom,\" said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it\\naloud; and in another moment, it was out of sight.\\n\\nAlice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying\\nto make out which were the two sides of it. At last she stretched her\\narms \\'round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge\\nwith each hand.\\n\\n\"And now which is which?\" she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\\nthe right-hand bit to try the effect. The next moment she felt a violent\\nblow underneath her chin--it had struck her foot!\\n\\nShe was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, as she was\\nshrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other\\nbit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was\\nhardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last and managed to\\nswallow a morsel of the left-hand bit....\\n\\n\"Come, my head\\'s free at last!\" said Alice; but all she could see, when\\nshe looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise\\nlike a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.\\n\\n\"Where _have_ my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I\\ncan\\'t see you?\" She was delighted to find that her neck would bend\\nabout easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded in\\ncurving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among\\nthe leaves, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry--a large\\npigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its\\nwings.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\"Serpent!\" cried the Pigeon.\\n\\n\"I\\'m _not_ a serpent!\" said Alice indignantly. \"Let me alone!\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve tried the roots of trees, and I\\'ve tried banks, and I\\'ve tried\\nhedges,\" the Pigeon went on, \"but those serpents! There\\'s no pleasing\\nthem!\"\\n\\nAlice was more and more puzzled.\\n\\n\"As if it wasn\\'t trouble enough hatching the eggs,\" said the Pigeon,\\n\"but I must be on the look-out for serpents, night and day! And just as\\nI\\'d taken the highest tree in the wood,\" continued the Pigeon, raising\\nits voice to a shriek, \"and just as I was thinking I should be free of\\nthem at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh,\\nSerpent!\"\\n\\n\"But I\\'m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!\" said Alice. \"I\\'m a--I\\'m a--I\\'m a\\nlittle girl,\" she added rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number\\nof changes she had gone through that day.\\n\\n\"You\\'re looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough,\" said the Pigeon;\\n\"and what does it matter to me whether you\\'re a little girl or a\\nserpent?\"\\n\\n\"It matters a good deal to _me_,\" said Alice hastily; \"but I\\'m not\\nlooking for eggs, as it happens, and if I was, I shouldn\\'t want\\n_yours_--I don\\'t like them raw.\"\\n\\n\"Well, be off, then!\" said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\\ndown again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as\\nshe could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and\\nevery now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After awhile she\\nremembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and\\nshe set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the\\nother, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had\\nsucceeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\\n\\nIt was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it\\nfelt quite strange at first. \"The next thing is to get into that\\nbeautiful garden--how _is_ that to be done, I wonder?\" As she said this,\\nshe came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about\\nfour feet high. \"Whoever lives there,\" thought Alice, \"it\\'ll never do to\\ncome upon them _this_ size; why, I should frighten them out of their\\nwits!\" She did not venture to go near the house till she had brought\\nherself down to nine inches high.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVI--PIG AND PEPPER\\n\\n\\nFor a minute or two she stood looking at the house, when suddenly a\\nfootman in livery came running out of the wood (judging by his face\\nonly, she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door\\nwith his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a\\nround face and large eyes like a frog.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\\nand this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, \"For the\\nDuchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.\" The\\nFrog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, \"From the Queen. An\\ninvitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\" Then they both bowed low\\nand their curls got entangled together.\\n\\nWhen Alice next peeped out, the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was\\nsitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.\\nAlice went timidly up to the door and knocked.\\n\\n\"There\\'s no sort of use in knocking,\" said the Footman, \"and that for\\ntwo reasons. First, because I\\'m on the same side of the door as you are;\\nsecondly, because they\\'re making such a noise inside, no one could\\npossibly hear you.\" And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary noise\\ngoing on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then\\na great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.\\n\\n\"How am I to get in?\" asked Alice.\\n\\n\"_Are_ you to get in at all?\" said the Footman. \"That\\'s the first\\nquestion, you know.\"\\n\\nAlice opened the door and went in. The door led right into a large\\nkitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other; the Duchess\\nwas sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the\\ncook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large caldron which seemed to\\nbe full of soup.\\n\\n\"There\\'s certainly too much pepper in that soup!\" Alice said to herself,\\nas well as she could for sneezing. Even the Duchess sneezed\\noccasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\\nalternately without a moment\\'s pause. The only two creatures in the\\nkitchen that did _not_ sneeze were the cook and a large cat, which was\\ngrinning from ear to ear.\\n\\n\"Please would you tell me,\" said Alice, a little timidly, \"why your cat\\ngrins like that?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a Cheshire-Cat,\" said the Duchess, \"and that\\'s why.\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t know that Cheshire-Cats always grinned; in fact, I didn\\'t know\\nthat cats _could_ grin,\" said Alice.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t know much,\" said the Duchess, \"and that\\'s a fact.\"\\n\\nJust then the cook took the caldron of soup off the fire, and at once\\nset to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the\\nbaby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans,\\nplates and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them, even when they\\nhit her, and the baby was howling so much already that it was quite\\nimpossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\\n\\n\"Oh, _please_ mind what you\\'re doing!\" cried Alice, jumping up and down\\nin an agony of terror.\\n\\n\"Here! You may nurse it a bit, if you like!\" the Duchess said to Alice,\\nflinging the baby at her as she spoke. \"I must go and get ready to play\\ncroquet with the Queen,\" and she hurried out of the room.\\n\\nAlice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped\\nlittle creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions. \"If I\\ndon\\'t take this child away with me,\" thought Alice, \"they\\'re sure to\\nkill it in a day or two. Wouldn\\'t it be murder to leave it behind?\" She\\nsaid the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply.\\n\\n\"If you\\'re going to turn into a pig, my dear,\" said Alice, \"I\\'ll have\\nnothing more to do with you. Mind now!\"\\n\\nAlice was just beginning to think to herself, \"Now, what am I to do with\\nthis creature, when I get it home?\" when it grunted again so violently\\nthat Alice looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there\\ncould be _no_ mistake about it--it was neither more nor less than a pig;\\nso she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it\\ntrot away quietly into the wood.\\n\\nAlice was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire-Cat sitting on a\\nbough of a tree a few yards off. The Cat only grinned when it saw her.\\n\"Cheshire-Puss,\" began Alice, rather timidly, \"would you please tell me\\nwhich way I ought to go from here?\"\\n\\n\"In _that_ direction,\" the Cat said, waving the right paw \\'round, \"lives\\na Hatter; and in _that_ direction,\" waving the other paw, \"lives a March\\nHare. Visit either you like; they\\'re both mad.\"\\n\\n\"But I don\\'t want to go among mad people,\" Alice remarked.\\n\\n\"Oh, you can\\'t help that,\" said the Cat; \"we\\'re all mad here. Do you\\nplay croquet with the Queen to-day?\"\\n\\n\"I should like it very much,\" said Alice, \"but I haven\\'t been invited\\nyet.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll see me there,\" said the Cat, and vanished.\\n\\nAlice had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of\\nthe March Hare; it was so large a house that she did not like to go near\\ntill she had nibbled some more of the left-hand bit of mushroom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVII--A MAD TEA-PARTY\\n\\n\\nThere was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\\nMarch Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it; a Dormouse was sitting\\nbetween them, fast asleep.\\n\\nThe table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\\none corner of it. \"No room! No room!\" they cried out when they saw Alice\\ncoming. \"There\\'s _plenty_ of room!\" said Alice indignantly, and she sat\\ndown in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.\\n\\nThe Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this, but all he said\\nwas \"Why is a raven like a writing-desk?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad they\\'ve begun asking riddles--I believe I can guess that,\" she\\nadded aloud.\\n\\n\"Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?\" said the\\nMarch Hare.\\n\\n\"Exactly so,\" said Alice.\\n\\n\"Then you should say what you mean,\" the March Hare went on.\\n\\n\"I do,\" Alice hastily replied; \"at least--at least I mean what I\\nsay--that\\'s the same thing, you know.\"\\n\\n\"You might just as well say,\" added the Dormouse, which seemed to be\\ntalking in its sleep, \"that \\'I breathe when I sleep\\' is the same thing\\nas \\'I sleep when I breathe!\\'\"\\n\\n\"It _is_ the same thing with you,\" said the Hatter, and he poured a\\nlittle hot tea upon its nose. The Dormouse shook its head impatiently\\nand said, without opening its eyes, \"Of course, of course; just what I\\nwas going to remark myself.\"\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\"Have you guessed the riddle yet?\" the Hatter said, turning to Alice\\nagain.\\n\\n\"No, I give it up,\" Alice replied. \"What\\'s the answer?\"\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t the slightest idea,\" said the Hatter.\\n\\n\"Nor I,\" said the March Hare.\\n\\nAlice gave a weary sigh. \"I think you might do something better with the\\ntime,\" she said, \"than wasting it in asking riddles that have no\\nanswers.\"\\n\\n\"Take some more tea,\" the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve had nothing yet,\" Alice replied in an offended tone, \"so I can\\'t\\ntake more.\"\\n\\n\"You mean you can\\'t take _less_,\" said the Hatter; \"it\\'s very easy to\\ntake _more_ than nothing.\"\\n\\nAt this, Alice got up and walked off. The Dormouse fell asleep instantly\\nand neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\\nlooked back once or twice; the last time she saw them, they were\\ntrying to put the Dormouse into the tea-pot.\\n\\n[Illustration: The Trial of the Knave of Hearts.]\\n\\n\"At any rate, I\\'ll never go _there_ again!\" said Alice, as she picked\\nher way through the wood. \"It\\'s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in\\nall my life!\" Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees\\nhad a door leading right into it. \"That\\'s very curious!\" she thought. \"I\\nthink I may as well go in at once.\" And in she went.\\n\\nOnce more she found herself in the long hall and close to the little\\nglass table. Taking the little golden key, she unlocked the door that\\nled into the garden. Then she set to work nibbling at the mushroom (she\\nhad kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high;\\nthen she walked down the little passage; and _then_--she found herself\\nat last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the\\ncool fountains.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVIII--THE QUEEN\\'S CROQUET GROUND\\n\\n\\nA large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden; the roses\\ngrowing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily\\npainting them red. Suddenly their eyes chanced to fall upon Alice, as\\nshe stood watching them. \"Would you tell me, please,\" said Alice, a\\nlittle timidly, \"why you are painting those roses?\"\\n\\nFive and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began, in a low\\nvoice, \"Why, the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a\\n_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and, if the Queen\\nwas to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So\\nyou see, Miss, we\\'re doing our best, afore she comes, to--\" At this\\nmoment, Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called\\nout, \"The Queen! The Queen!\" and the three gardeners instantly threw\\nthemselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps\\nand Alice looked \\'round, eager to see the Queen.\\n\\nFirst came ten soldiers carrying clubs, with their hands and feet at the\\ncorners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with\\ndiamonds. After these came the royal children; there were ten of them,\\nall ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and\\nQueens, and among them Alice recognized the White Rabbit. Then followed\\nthe Knave of Hearts, carrying the King\\'s crown on a crimson velvet\\ncushion; and last of all this grand procession came THE KING AND THE\\nQUEEN OF HEARTS.\\n\\nWhen the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked\\nat her, and the Queen said severely, \"Who is this?\" She said it to the\\nKnave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.\\n\\n\"My name is Alice, so please Your Majesty,\" said Alice very politely;\\nbut she added to herself, \"Why, they\\'re only a pack of cards, after\\nall!\"\\n\\n\"Can you play croquet?\" shouted the Queen. The question was evidently\\nmeant for Alice.\\n\\n\"Yes!\" said Alice loudly.\\n\\n\"Come on, then!\" roared the Queen.\\n\\n\"It\\'s--it\\'s a very fine day!\" said a timid voice to Alice. She was\\nwalking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.\\n\\n\"Very,\" said Alice. \"Where\\'s the Duchess?\"\\n\\n\"Hush! Hush!\" said the Rabbit. \"She\\'s under sentence of execution.\"\\n\\n\"What for?\" said Alice.\\n\\n\"She boxed the Queen\\'s ears--\" the Rabbit began.\\n\\n\"Get to your places!\" shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\\npeople began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\\nother. However, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\\nbegan.\\n\\nAlice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her\\nlife; it was all ridges and furrows. The croquet balls were live\\nhedgehogs, and the mallets live flamingos and the soldiers had to double\\nthemselves up and stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\\n\\nThe players all played at once, without waiting for turns, quarrelling\\nall the while and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time,\\nthe Queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting,\\n\"Off with his head!\" or \"Off with her head!\" about once in a minute.\\n\\n\"They\\'re dreadfully fond of beheading people here,\" thought Alice; \"the\\ngreat wonder is that there\\'s anyone left alive!\"\\n\\nShe was looking about for some way of escape, when she noticed a curious\\nappearance in the air. \"It\\'s the Cheshire-Cat,\" she said to herself;\\n\"now I shall have somebody to talk to.\"\\n\\n\"How are you getting on?\" said the Cat.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think they play at all fairly,\" Alice said, in a rather\\ncomplaining tone; \"and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can\\'t hear\\noneself speak--and they don\\'t seem to have any rules in particular.\"\\n\\n\"How do you like the Queen?\" said the Cat in a low voice.\\n\\n\"Not at all,\" said Alice.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nAlice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going\\non. So she went off in search of her hedgehog. The hedgehog was engaged\\nin a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent\\nopportunity for croqueting one of them with the other; the only\\ndifficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of\\nthe garden, where Alice could see it trying, in a helpless sort of way,\\nto fly up into a tree. She caught the flamingo and tucked it away under\\nher arm, that it might not escape again.\\n\\nJust then Alice ran across the Duchess (who was now out of prison). She\\ntucked her arm affectionately into Alice\\'s and they walked off together.\\nAlice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper. She was a\\nlittle startled, however, when she heard the voice of the Duchess close\\nto her ear. \"You\\'re thinking about something, my dear, and that makes\\nyou forget to talk.\"\\n\\n\"The game\\'s going on rather better now,\" Alice said, by way of keeping\\nup the conversation a little.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis so,\" said the Duchess; \"and the moral of that is--\\'Oh, \\'tis love,\\n\\'tis love that makes the world go \\'round!\\'\"\\n\\n\"Somebody said,\" Alice whispered, \"that it\\'s done by everybody minding\\nhis own business!\"\\n\\n\"Ah, well! It means much the same thing,\" said the Duchess, digging her\\nsharp little chin into Alice\\'s shoulder, as she added \"and the moral of\\n_that_ is--\\'Take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of\\nthemselves.\\'\"\\n\\nTo Alice\\'s great surprise, the Duchess\\'s arm that was linked into hers\\nbegan to tremble. Alice looked up and there stood the Queen in front of\\nthem, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm!\\n\\n\"Now, I give you fair warning,\" shouted the Queen, stamping on the\\nground as she spoke, \"either you or your head must be off, and that in\\nabout half no time. Take your choice!\" The Duchess took her choice, and\\nwas gone in a moment.\\n\\n\"Let\\'s go on with the game,\" the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too\\nmuch frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the\\ncroquet-ground.\\n\\nAll the time they were playing, the Queen never left off quarreling with\\nthe other players and shouting, \"Off with his head!\" or \"Off with her\\nhead!\" By the end of half an hour or so, all the players, except the\\nKing, the Queen and Alice, were in custody of the soldiers and under\\nsentence of execution.\\n\\nThen the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and walked away with\\nAlice.\\n\\nAlice heard the King say in a low voice to the company generally, \"You\\nare all pardoned.\"\\n\\nSuddenly the cry \"The Trial\\'s beginning!\" was heard in the distance, and\\nAlice ran along with the others.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIX--WHO STOLE THE TARTS?\\n\\n\\nThe King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they\\narrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little\\nbirds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was\\nstanding before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard\\nhim; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand\\nand a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court\\nwas a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it. \"I wish they\\'d get the\\ntrial done,\" Alice thought, \"and hand \\'round the refreshments!\"\\n\\nThe judge, by the way, was the King and he wore his crown over his great\\nwig. \"That\\'s the jury-box,\" thought Alice; \"and those twelve creatures\\n(some were animals and some were birds) I suppose they are the jurors.\"\\n\\nJust then the White Rabbit cried out \"Silence in the court!\"\\n\\n\"Herald, read the accusation!\" said the King.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nOn this, the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, then\\nunrolled the parchment-scroll and read as follows:\\n\\n    \"The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,\\n      All on a summer day;\\n    The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts\\n      And took them quite away!\"\\n\\n\"Call the first witness,\" said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three\\nblasts on the trumpet and called out, \"First witness!\"\\n\\nThe first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand\\nand a piece of bread and butter in the other.\\n\\n\"You ought to have finished,\" said the King. \"When did you begin?\"\\n\\nThe Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the\\ncourt, arm in arm with the Dormouse. \"Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it\\nwas,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Give your evidence,\" said the King, \"and don\\'t be nervous, or I\\'ll have\\nyou executed on the spot.\"\\n\\nThis did not seem to encourage the witness at all; he kept shifting from\\none foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and, in his\\nconfusion, he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread\\nand butter.\\n\\nJust at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation--she was\\nbeginning to grow larger again.\\n\\nThe miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread and butter and went\\ndown on one knee. \"I\\'m a poor man, Your Majesty,\" he began.\\n\\n\"You\\'re a _very_ poor _speaker_,\" said the King.\\n\\n\"You may go,\" said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court.\\n\\n\"Call the next witness!\" said the King.\\n\\nThe next witness was the Duchess\\'s cook. She carried the pepper-box in\\nher hand and the people near the door began sneezing all at once.\\n\\n\"Give your evidence,\" said the King.\\n\\n\"Sha\\'n\\'t,\" said the cook.\\n\\nThe King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said, in a low voice,\\n\"Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.\"\\n\\n\"Well, if I must, I must,\" the King said. \"What are tarts made of?\"\\n\\n\"Pepper, mostly,\" said the cook.\\n\\nFor some minutes the whole court was in confusion and by the time they\\nhad settled down again, the cook had disappeared.\\n\\n\"Never mind!\" said the King, \"call the next witness.\"\\n\\nAlice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list. Imagine her\\nsurprise when he read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the\\nname \"Alice!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX--ALICE\\'S EVIDENCE\\n\\n\\n\"Here!\" cried Alice. She jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over\\nthe jury-box, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd\\nbelow.\\n\\n\"Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!\" she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay.\\n\\n\"The trial cannot proceed,\" said the King, \"until all the jurymen are\\nback in their proper places--_all_,\" he repeated with great emphasis,\\nlooking hard at Alice.\\n\\n\"What do you know about this business?\" the King said to Alice.\\n\\n\"Nothing whatever,\" said Alice.\\n\\nThe King then read from his book: \"Rule forty-two. _All persons more\\nthan a mile high to leave the court_.\"\\n\\n\"_I\\'m_ not a mile high,\" said Alice.\\n\\n\"Nearly two miles high,\" said the Queen.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\"Well, I sha\\'n\\'t go, at any rate,\" said Alice.\\n\\nThe King turned pale and shut his note-book hastily. \"Consider your\\nverdict,\" he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.\\n\\n\"There\\'s more evidence to come yet, please Your Majesty,\" said the White\\nRabbit, jumping up in a great hurry. \"This paper has just been picked\\nup. It seems to be a letter written by the prisoner to--to somebody.\" He\\nunfolded the paper as he spoke and added, \"It isn\\'t a letter, after all;\\nit\\'s a set of verses.\"\\n\\n\"Please, Your Majesty,\" said the Knave, \"I didn\\'t write it and they\\ncan\\'t prove that I did; there\\'s no name signed at the end.\"\\n\\n\"You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you\\'d have signed your\\nname like an honest man,\" said the King. There was a general clapping of\\nhands at this.\\n\\n\"Read them,\" he added, turning to the White Rabbit.\\n\\nThere was dead silence in the court whilst the White Rabbit read out the\\nverses.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the most important piece of evidence we\\'ve heard yet,\" said the\\nKing.\\n\\n\"_I_ don\\'t believe there\\'s an atom of meaning in it,\" ventured Alice.\\n\\n\"If there\\'s no meaning in it,\" said the King, \"that saves a world of\\ntrouble, you know, as we needn\\'t try to find any. Let the jury consider\\ntheir verdict.\"\\n\\n\"No, no!\" said the Queen. \"Sentence first--verdict afterwards.\"\\n\\n\"Stuff and nonsense!\" said Alice loudly. \"The idea of having the\\nsentence first!\"\\n\\n\"Hold your tongue!\" said the Queen, turning purple.\\n\\n\"I won\\'t!\" said Alice.\\n\\n\"Off with her head!\" the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody\\nmoved.\\n\\n\"Who cares for _you_?\" said Alice (she had grown to her full size by\\nthis time). \"You\\'re nothing but a pack of cards!\"\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nAt this, the whole pack rose up in the air and came flying down upon\\nher; she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and\\ntried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her\\nhead in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead\\nleaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.\\n\\n\"Wake up, Alice dear!\" said her sister. \"Why, what a long sleep you\\'ve\\nhad!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'ve had such a curious dream!\" said Alice. And she told her\\nsister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange adventures\\nof hers that you have just been reading about. Alice got up and ran off,\\nthinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had\\nbeen.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ALICE\\'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND ***\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\\ngenerations.

The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Email contact links and up\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\n\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\\nvolunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\n\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n\\n')]"

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOverview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\n\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\n\\nExamples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\n\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\n\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\n\\nExperiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\n\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\n\\nAfter fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\n\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\n\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\n\\nComparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\n\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCategorization of human memory.\\n\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\n\\nComparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\n\\nA picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\n\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\n\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user\\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\n\\nPseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\n\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\\'s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\n\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.
